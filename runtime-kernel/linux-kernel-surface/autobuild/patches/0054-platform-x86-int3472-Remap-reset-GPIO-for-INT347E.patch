Subject: [PATCH 54/62] platform/x86: int3472: Remap reset GPIO for INT347E

ACPI _HID INT347E represents the OmniVision 7251 camera sensor. The
driver for this sensor expects a single pin named "enable", but on
some Microsoft Surface platforms the sensor is assigned a single
GPIO who's type flag is INT3472_GPIO_TYPE_RESET.

Remap the GPIO pin's function from "reset" to "enable". This is done
outside of the existing remap table since it is a more widespread
discrepancy than that method is designed for. Additionally swap the
polarity of the pin to match the driver's expectation.
